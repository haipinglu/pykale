## pykaleMI: Machine Learning for Medical Images 

### Objectives
* To share our resources and expertise, and know each other better
* To build *reusable* tools for internal works first and go public later
* To avoid duplicated efforts and identify key missing components 

### Principles
* Keep it **lean** in content, memory, and time. Quality first!
* Use existing top-quality code when it fits: **credit + declare +license**
* Welcome contributions from external members too: *@Haiping* to invite  

### Pipeline
* Data loading (input)
* Data preprocessing
* Learning and prediction (joint or separate)
    * Representation learning / embedding (feature extraction/selection)
    * Prediction (output)
* Evaluation (metrics)
* Post analysis (visualisation, interpretation)
* System-level integration 

### Project specific (rest: common)
* Data and tasks
    * Brain fMRI for diagnosis, neural decoding
    * Cardiac MRI (CMRI) for diagnosis, prognosis
    * CMRI Landmark localisation
    * CMRI segmentation?
* Recommended package(s)
    * [MONAI](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI): deep learning-based healthcare imaging workflows
* Related projects (*@Haiping* to contribute)
