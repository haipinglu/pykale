We aim to develop a library to accelerate **interdisciplinary** research on machine learning for medical imaging, graphs/networks, and computer vision. Our library will be complementary to existing libraries and beter facilitate **cross-disciplinary** collaborations. To join this effort, clone or fork this repository and push your contributions when ready for review and merge. Please ensure your code is **well documented** (please read `docs/`).

## Overview

### Plan

* Early Oct 2020: First public release (for MICCAI20 paper), to discuss
* Long term: Satisfy the [requirements](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/join) to join the [pytorch ecosysmtem](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/)

### Objectives

* Share our resources/expertise and know each other better
* Build reusable+trustable tools for us first and the community next
* Avoid duplicated efforts and identify key missing components

### Principles

* Keep it **lean** in content, and memory/time cost. Quality first!
* Use existing top code when it fits (**credit@top + license**) and build when NA or we can do much better
* Keep it as modular as possible, following the pipeline below

### Pipeline-based modules

* `loaddata` load data from disk or online resources as in input
* `prepdata` preprocess data to fit machine learning modules below (transforms)
* `embed` embed data in a new space to learn a new representation (feature extraction/selection)
* `predict` predict a desired output
* `evaluate` evaluate the performance using some metrics
* `interpret` interpret the features and outputs via post-prediction analysis mainly via visualisation
* `pipeline` specify a machine learning workflow by combining several other modules

We need to design these core modules to be generic, reusable, customizable, and not specific to a particular dataset. 

### Dataset-specific modules

* `examples`: Real-application on particular datasets, with notebooks, GUI applications, and [TorchScript](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) support.

## Coding

### Coding style

* Configure learning systems using [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) following [YACS](https://github.com/rbgirshick/yacs). Example: [ISONet](https://github.com/HaozhiQi/ISONet)
* Use [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/) when possible and follow its coding style. **Highly recommend** [PyTorch Lightning](https://towardsdatascience.com/from-pytorch-to-pytorch-lightning-a-gentle-introduction-b371b7caaf09)
* Key references include [MONAI](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI) for `medim`, [pytorch_geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric) for `graph`, and [kornia](https://github.com/kornia/kornia) for `vision`.
